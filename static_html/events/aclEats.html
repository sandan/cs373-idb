<h3> Austin is known for its food and The Austin City Limits Music Festival is no different.

With signature ACL fare, such as the Hot and Crunchy Mighty Cone, vegetarian and gluten-free considerations and options far from funnel cakes or turkey legs, Austin Eats showcases the most premier Austin restaurants. Food vendors will be serving all day. All vendors accept cash, and there are plenty of ATMâ€™s available.</h3><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bowvhJtDM4A?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
