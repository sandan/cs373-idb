Artist: Pearl Jam
Bio: Pearl Jam is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), Mike McCready (guitar), and Eddie Vedder (vocals). The band's fifth and current drummer is Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos, giving interviews and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame." To date, the band has sold more than 31.5 million records in the U.S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s."

Artist: Beck
Bio: Beck Hansen, born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970, was raised in an artistic, Scientologist family in Los Angeles, California. Beck began playing music in local coffeehouses around 1990, and has been astounding and delighting critics with his unique output ever since. Beck released his first hit single, "Loser," from his debut album, Golden Feelings, in 1993. The following year, he released his third studio album, Mellow Gold, which was a hit. Later albums include Odelay (1996), Guero (2005) and Morning Phase (2014). Beck's music has been deemed a witty fusion of rock, folk, rap and hip-hop.

Artist: Foster the People
Bio: Los Angeles electro-indie-pop-rock band Foster the People never had much official “indie” status, having been scooped up to the major leagues within their first year of performing. After making a decent splash at music festivals and creating a serious buzz with infectious numbers such as “Pumped Up Kicks” and “Helena Beat,” Foster the People are making good with a debut album that’s as fresh as sunshine and as refreshing as a surf wave. The group have touches of California sunbaked pop in their repertoire, but there’s also a dark Euro-disco groove lurking under the hooks of “Don’t Stop (Color On the Walls)” and the thick, goth-like wash of “Waste.” Singer Mark Foster plays and programs enough keyboards to give the songs a grand entrance, while other members contribute to the production to jazz up and space out tracks like “Miss You” and “Life On the Nickel.” “Warrant” works under an ambient haze. “Houdini” charges with an unforgiving groove, squeaky synths and a falsetto that reaches back to the ‘70s disco era.

Artist: Skrillex
Bio: Sonny Moore found club and mainstream stardom beginning in 2008, when he swapped his gig as post-hardcore frontman for From First to Last and created the dancefloor-oriented project Skrillex. He originally used the name for live DJ sets, but in 2009 the project moved into the studio with Skrillex remixing the likes of Lady Gaga (“Bad Romance”) and Snoop Dogg (“Sensual Seduction”). In 2010, the self-released digital download EP My Name Is Skrillex appeared, combining the Benny Benassi and Deadmau5 styles of electro with the over the top samples and giant noises of acts like the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. Moore would sign with Deadmau5’s Mau5trap label that same year, where he would release his second EP, Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites, along with the club hit “Kill Everybody.” If topping the club charts didn't prove the producer had arrived, a 2011 appearance on the revived Beavis & Butthead television series did, along with his collaboration with the surviving members of the Doors called "Breakin' a Sweat." The recording of the track was captured in the documentary film RE:GENERATION, while the song itself landed on Skrillex's Bangarang EP, which appeared in early 2012.

Artist: Lana Del Rey
Bio: Vocalist Lana Del Rey makes atmospheric, orchestral, retro-'60s-sounding pop that showcases her torchy image and sensuous singing style. A native of Lake Placid, New York, Del Rey released both the "Kill Kill" single and a 2010 debut album under her given name, Lizzy Grant, tagging the album "a.k.a. Lana Del Rey." It would be a few years before Grant would undergo a complete transformation into her alter ego, modeling the Lana Del Rey persona into a Hollywood pop femme fatale character. A video for the single "Video Games" appeared online in August of 2011 and drew considerable buzz, as did a secret show she performed at Brooklyn's Glasslands Gallery that September. Del Rey's EP, featuring the songs "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans," was released in fall 2011. Amidst a heavy dose of hype, her debut album Born to Die was announced by Interscope for release early the following year. Del Rey cemented the anticipation around the album with an appearance on Saturday Night Live, becoming the first artist since Natalie Imbruglia in 1998 to perform on the show before the release of her debut album. Born to Die hit number one in several European countries, reached number two on the U.S. charts, and eventually sold several million copies worldwide. By the end of 2012, Del Rey had released her next work, a mini-album titled Paradise, with a trailer single called "Ride." Songs from Paradise also found their way into the soundtrack of Tropico, a short film Del Rey worked on in collaboration with director Anthony Mandler. The strangely psychedelic take on biblical themes premiered at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in early December before being released online. The year 2014 saw the release of a much-anticipated Born to Die follow-up in the form of Ultraviolence, a somewhat darker and more mature look into Del Rey's sound produced by the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach.

Artist: Phantogram
Bio: Phantogram are an electronic rock duo from upstate New York whose music incorporates psychedelic pop vocals, J Dilla-style hip-hop beats, and shoegazing sensibility. Founded in 2007 and based in Saratoga Springs, New York, the duo is comprised of longtime friends Josh Carter (guitar, vocals) and Sarah Barthel (keyboards, vocals), who originally hail from the nearby small town of Greenwich, New York. Originally known as Charlie Everywhere and associated with the local independent label Sub-Bombin Records, the duo released the eponymous Phantogram EP in March 2009 and sparked widespread interest with two songs in particular, "Mouthful of Diamonds" and "When I'm Small." Phantogram subsequently released the Running from the Cops EP in May 2009 on the international label BBE Records. The duo finally made its full-length album debut with Eyelid Movies (2010), an 11-track album featuring the four previously released EP songs "Mouthful of Diamonds," "When I'm Small," "Running from the Cops," and "Bloody Palms." The album was released internationally by BBE Records, domestically by Barsuk Records, and on vinyl by Ghostly International. The duo returned in late 2011 with the Nightlife EP, which sold enough to hit the lower reaches of the U.S. charts. They continued to tour heavily but found the time to collaborate with OutKast's Big Boi on his second album Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumours (2012) and also featured on the Flaming Lips track "Young Lust" in 2013. Their success continued in 2013 when fan favorite "When I'm Small" appeared on the MTV adaptation of the hit U.K. show Skins and they released a four-song, self-titled EP. Toward the end of the year they returned to Upstate New York and began to write and record their second full-length album. The pair traveled to L.A. to put the finishing touches on the record, titled Voices, with producer John Hill (Santigold, M.I.A.). It was released by their new label Republic in early 2014.

Artist: Childish Gambino
Bio: When he's not busy writing for television, performing with his sketch group Derrick Comedy, or acting on the NBC comedy Community, Donald Glover somehow finds the time to make beats and rap as his alter ego, Childish Gambino. The project took on a life of its own after Glover found someone to rhyme over the beats he’d been making in his spare time. In 2008, he released his first record as Childish Gambino, Sick Boi, and followed it up the next year with Poindexter. In 2010 he released two mixtapes, I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2, which found him rapping over indie rock gems like Sleigh Bells' "Infinity Guitars" and Grizzly Bear’s "Two Weeks." Later that year, he released his third full-length underground album, Culdesac. The year 2011 found him going legit with Camp, his official debut for the Glass Note label. In 2012, Glover released a mixtape titled Royalty, which he released as a free download and which featured a range of musicians including Beck and Das Racist's Heems. He also appeared on Leona Lewis' track "Trouble" from her album Glassheart. In 2013, Glover revealed he had left Community, but would still appear in a handful of episodes in Season 5, and he concentrated on his music career. He returned again to music as Childish Gambino and released the single "3005" from third album, Because the Internet, which was released in late 2013
